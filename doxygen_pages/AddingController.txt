\page AddingController Adding a new chipset

\page AddingController 

Code for new controllers are stored in `devices/`. Use a descriptive name for the corresponding `.c` and `.h` file.

The best way to see how to do this is to view the files already in there.

The code in here define routines which are specific for the chipset. This does not include the Required Functions used in the deive specific code.

\see \ref AddingDevice

Code in these files must only call functions which are:

- those *required* functions in the `devices/*.h` files
- within the same file as itself
- functions declared by glcd.h

\see \ref DeviceRequiredFunctions

If you *must* do something that is compiler specfic, seperate the code using preprocessor commands that isolate the compiler in question. But try and avoid this if possible.
