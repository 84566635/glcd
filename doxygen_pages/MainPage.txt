\section Introduction Introduction

Welcome to GLCD, an open source graphic LCD library written by Andy Gock.

http://micro.gock.net/

https://github.com/andygock/glcd

This library has been written cleanly, to allow easy modification for use with different microcontroller devices and controller chipsets. Logic relating to devices and controllers are palced in seperate files and specific implementations can be chosen by the use of special defined symbols.

It is suitable for monochrome (black and white) LCDs with page by page data and command write style data transfer protocol.
