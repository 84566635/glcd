glcd - Graphic LCD Library

by Andy Gock

Works with:
- PCD8544 based LCDs, e.g Nokia 3110 and 5110 LCDs

MCUs supported:
- Atmel AVR 8-bit
- NXP LPC111x ARM Cortex

The following symbols need to be set for the compiler:

Pick microcontroller type (pick one only):
GLCD_DEVICE_LPX111X
GLCD_DEVICE_AVR8

Pick LCD controller type (pick one only):
GLCD_CONTROLLER_PCD8544

These symbols need to be set in the configuration options of your IDE, usually
in the "defined symbols" section, or they can be defined in a makefile
as -D options.

e.g "-DGLCD_DEVICE_LPC111X"
