glcd - Graphic LCD Library

by Andy Gock

Works with:
- PCD8544 based LCDs, e.g Nokia 3110 and 5110 LCDs
- ST7565R serial interface (used in Newhaven Display NHD-C12864WC-FSW-FBW-3V3-M)
- NT75451 parallel interface (used on NGX BlueBoards)

MCUs supported:
- Atmel AVR 8-bit
- NXP LPC111x ARM Cortex
- NXP LPC11Uxx ARM Cortex

The following symbols need to be set for the compiler:

Pick microcontroller type (pick one only):
GLCD_DEVICE_LPX111X
GLCD_DEVICE_LPX11UXX
GLCD_DEVICE_AVR8

Pick LCD controller type (pick one only):
GLCD_CONTROLLER_PCD8544
GLCD_CONTROLLER_ST7565R
GLCD_CONTROLLER_NT75451

These symbols need to be set in the configuration options of your IDE, usually
in the "defined symbols" section, or they can be defined in a makefile
as -D options.

e.g "-DGLCD_DEVICE_LPC111X"

Refer to Doxygen generated pages for detailed documentation.
